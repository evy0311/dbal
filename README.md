# Doctrine DBAL - Postgres Additions

Powerful database abstraction layer with many features for database schema introspection, schema management and PDO abstraction.

## What I've Added:

* Added CIText (Case-Insensitive Text) support for Postgres Platform. This works well when using this package here: [Xethron/migrations-genertator](https://github.com/Xethron/migrations-generator)
